  <h2 id="#about">Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a powerful way for developing web applications. It gives us power for more consistency throughout all the web browsers. Some principles of progressive enhancement includes that basic content and basic functionality should be allowed to all web browsers. Progressive enhancement also allows us to make the content we created to look more appealing with externally linked css.</p>
  <h2 id="#revised">Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I started the project out by making it kind of bright with the purple headers and with the white backround. I also thought that putting as many images as I could where they would fit would also be a good idea to catch some attention towards the site. I asked my dad, who is somewhat interested in space and has visites some space sites before, what he thought about my site. He said that he thought there were too many unnecesary images and that the somewhat bright color scheme didnt really match the space theme. So I took out what I thought was unnecesary and changed the theme to sort of a dark mode to match the whole space theme to keep it simple just as my dad said.</p>
